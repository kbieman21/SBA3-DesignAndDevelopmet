## SBA3 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

Responsive grid-based page with HTML and Tailwind CSS
This project is from Frontend Mentor Challenges Bento Grid



## Overview
The goal of this project was to design and build a responsive grid-based page to demonstrate lesson learned about Tailwind CSS.
Each card represent different features, such as AI content writing, multi-platform scheduling, or audience growth statistics etc.

The layout adapts across different screen sizes

## Approaches and Customizations
I used Tailwind CSS for syling
I implemented a responsive grid layout using Tailwind's grid-col -1, grid-col -2, grid-col -4
Each card used min-h-[400px] for consistent hight
Applied col-span-2 and row-span-2


## Design and Customization
I custmized colors for each card
Responsive text- classes
optimized image handling with oject-contain, full width, and responsive scaling


## Performance Enhancement
I added loading="lazy" to images
I used utility classes for spacing such as padding, margin, gap

## Challenges and solutions
Chanllenges - add span to some cards
Solution - add responsive col-span or row-span



## Summary
This project was a great learning experience in responsive layout design using Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates the importance of adaptable UI components and design patterns that scale gracefully across screen sizes.
